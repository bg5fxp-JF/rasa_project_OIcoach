  utter_realistic:
  - text: |-
      So you are Realistic:

      Realistic individuals are active and stable and enjoy hands-on or manual activities, such as building, mechanics, machinery
      operation and athletics. They prefer to work with things rather than ideas and people. They enjoy engaging in physical
      activity and often like being outdoors and working with plants and animals. People who fall into this category generally
      prefer to “learn by doing” in a practical, task-oriented setting, as opposed to spending extended periods of time in a
      classroom. Realistic types tend to communicate in a frank, direct manner and value material things. They perceive
      themselves as skilled in mechanical and physical activities but may be uncomfortable or less adept with human relations.
      The preferred work environment of the realistic type fosters technical competencies and work that allows them to produce
      tangible results. Typical realistic careers include electrician, engineer, veterinarian and the military.
  utter_investigative:
  - text: |-
      So you are Investigative:

      Investigative individuals are analytical, intellectual and observant and enjoy research, mathematical or scientific activities.
      They are drawn to ambiguous challenges and may be stifled in highly structured environments. People who fall into this
      category enjoy using logic and solving highly complex, abstract problems. Because they are introspective and focused on
      creative problem solving, investigative types often work autonomously and do not seek leadership roles. They place a high
      value on science and learning and perceive themselves as scholarly and having scientific or mathematical ability but
      lacking leadership and persuasive skills. The preferred work environment of the investigative type encourages scientific
      competencies, allows independent work and focuses on solving abstract, complex problems in original ways. Typical
      investigative careers include medical technologist, biologist, chemist and systems analyst.
  utter_artistic:
  - text: |-
      So you are Artistic:

      Artistic individuals are original, intuitive and imaginative and enjoy creative activities, such as composing or playing
      music, writing, drawing or painting and acting in or directing stage productions. They seek opportunities for selfexpression through artistic creation. People who fall into this category prefer flexibility and ambiguity and have an
      aversion to convention and conformity. Artistic types are generally impulsive and emotional and tend to communicate in a
      very expressive and open manner. They value aesthetics and view themselves as creative, non-conforming and as
      appreciating or possessing musical, dramatic, artistic or writing abilities while lacking clerical or organizational skills. The
      preferred work environment of the artistic type fosters creative competencies, and encourages originality and use of the
      imagination in a flexible, unstructured setting. Typical artistic careers include musician, reporter and interior decorator.
  utter_social:
  - text: |-
      So you are Social:

      Social individuals are humanistic, idealistic, responsible and concerned with the welfare of others. They enjoy participating
      in group activities and helping, training, healing, counseling or developing others. They are generally focused on human
      relationships and enjoy social activities and solving interpersonal problems. Social types seek opportunities to work as part
      of a team, solve problems through discussions and utilize interpersonal skills but may avoid activities that involve
      systematic use of equipment or machines. Because they genuinely enjoy working with people, they communicate in a
      warm and tactful manner and can be persuasive. They view themselves as understanding, helpful, cheerful and skilled in
      teaching but lacking in mechanical ability. The preferred work environment of the social type encourages teamwork and
      allows for significant interaction with others. Typical social careers include teacher, counselor and social worker.
  utter_enterprising:
  - text: |-
      So you are Enterprising:

      Enterprising individuals are energetic, ambitious, adventurous, sociable and self-confident. They enjoy activities that
      require them to persuade others, such as sales, and seek out leadership roles. They are invigorated by using their
      interpersonal, leadership and persuasive abilities to obtain organizational goals or economic gain but may avoid routine or
      systematic activities. They are often effective public speakers and are generally sociable but may be viewed as
      domineering. They view themselves as assertive, self-confident and skilled in leadership and speaking but lacking in
      scientific abilities. The preferred work environment of the enterprising type encourages them to engage in activities, such
      as leadership, management and selling, and rewards them through the attainment of money, power and status. Typical
      enterprising careers include salesperson, business executive and manager.
  utter_conventional:
  - text: |-
      So you are Conventional:

      Conventional individuals are efficient, careful, conforming, organized and conscientious. They are comfortable working
      within an established chain of command and prefer carrying out well-defined instructions over assuming leadership roles.
      They prefer organized, systematic activities and have an aversion to ambiguity. They are skilled in and often enjoy
      maintaining and manipulating data, organizing schedules and operating office equipment. While they rarely seek leadership
      or “spotlight” roles, they are thorough, persistent and reliable in carrying out tasks. Conventional types view themselves as
      responsible, orderly and efficient, and possessing clerical, organizational and numerical abilities. They may also see
      themselves as unimaginative or lacking in creativity. The preferred work environment of the conventional type fosters
      organizational competencies, such as record keeping and data management, in a structured operation and places high value
      on conformity and dependability. Typical conventional careers include secretary, accountant and banker.
